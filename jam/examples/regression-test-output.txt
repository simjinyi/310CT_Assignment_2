The next action in the plan will cause the plan to fail
as it will invalidate this plan's context, which is evaluated
while the plan is executing.  The agent should look like it
"locks up" at this point since it has a goal but no longer
has an applicable way of achieving that goal since the precondition.
is no longer true.

Removing "locked up" goal of 'ACHIEVE precondition_test_done;'
This should allow the agent to continue and the agent
should exit because it has no more goals to achieve.
